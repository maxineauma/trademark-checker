# Trademark Checker
---------
This is a tool used for scraping WIPO (US/UK) trademark information.
You will find:
1. `lib.js` -- a library script created to streamline the scraping process. Do not touch.
2. `trademark.js` -- the actual script itself, which does all of the WIPO scraping. Creates a text file of your results.

###### Prerequisite Packages
Please install prerequisites with `npm install` before attempting to run any of these programs.

## Usage 
* `node trademark.js [query]`
